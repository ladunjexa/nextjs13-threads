```

Now let's dive into each folder and see what it contains.

#### app

`(auth)/` - `(root)/` - `(api)/`

In the app directory, nested folders are normally mapped to URL paths. However, you can mark a folder as a Route Group to prevent the folder from being included in the route's URL path.

This allows you to organize your route segments and project files into logical groups without affecting the URL path structure.

For example,
<img src="https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Froute-group-organisation.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_5QyHJTqH6oRYZ4QJMFM7s3b9DHZZ" width="50%" />

#### components

`atoms/` - `cards/` - `forms/` - `shared/` - `ui/`

The components directory contains all the components used in the application. The components are grouped into atoms, cards, forms, shared and ui.
the `ui` folder generated by `shadcn/ui` package and contains all the required shadcn components that used in the application.

#### constants

`index.js`

This is a JavaScript code contains all the constants used in the application, specifically the Sidebar Navigation (`sidebarLinks`), Profile Tabs (`profileTabs`) and Community Tabs (`communityTabs`) constants.

#### lib

`actions/` - `models/` - `validations/` - `mongoose.ts` - `uploadthing.ts` - `utils.ts`

The **lib** folder holds crucial components for _Threads App_:
**actions**: Manage actions for Community, Thread, and User entities using Mongoose for database interaction.
**models**: Define mongoose schemas for Community, Thread, and User entities.
**validations**: Provide validation schemas with Zod for Thread and User data.
**mongoose.ts**: Establishes and manages MongoDB connections for the application.
**uploadthing.ts**: Offers a React utility for simplified file uploads to UploadThing.
**utils.ts**: Contains various reusable utility functions.

#### public

`assets/` - `next.svg` - `vercel.svg`

The public directory contains the media used in the application. The assets folder contains all the images used in the application.

## :key: Environment Variables

Threads web application uses Clerk, UploadThing and MongoDB to handle authentication and user management, file upload and database. Therefore, you need to create accounts on Clerk, UploadThing and MongoDB and get your API keys and add them to the environment variables in the .env file.

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<CLERK_SECRET_KEY>
NEXT_CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET>

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=<CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=<CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=<CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=<CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL>

MONGODB_URL=<MONGODB_URL>
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=<UPLOADTHING_SECRET>
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=<UPLOADTHING_APP_ID>

```

## :toolbox: Getting Started

<!-- Installation -->

### :gear: Installation and Run Locally

#### Step 0:

Note :bangbang: the application uses Clerk for Authentication and User Management, therefore, you need to create Clerk account [here](https://clerk.dev/) and sets the `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` environment variables in `.env` file. Also, the different URLs for the Clerk sign-in, sign-up, after sign-in and after sign-up pages.

Note :bangbang: the application uses a MongoDB database, therefore, you need to create a database and connect it to the application, for this, change the `MONGODB_URL` environment variable in `.env` file located in `server` folder.

Note :bangbang: the application uses a UploadThing Cloud, therefore, you need to create UploadThing account [here](https://uploadthing.com/) and sets the `UPLOADTHING_SECRET` and `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID` environment variables in `.env` file.

After following all the instructions above, we'll want to create a new webhook on Clerk. To do this, go to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/), click on the "Webhooks" tab, and then click "Add Endpoint". For the Endpoint URL, enter `http://<PASTE-YOUR-LINK-HERE>/api/webhook/clerk`. For the evetnts, select the "organization", "organizationDomain", "organizationInvitation" and "organizationMembership". Then click "Create" to create the webhook. get the signing secret and set it as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable in `.env` file.

#### Step 1:

Download or clone this repo by using the link below:

```bash
 https://github.com/ladunjexa/nextjs13-threads.git
```

#### Step 2:

**Threads** using NPM (Node Package Manager), therefore, make sure that Node.js is installed by execute the following command in consle

```bash
  node -v
```

#### Step 3:

Go to root folder and execute the following command in console to get nodemon the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Step 4:

Go to root folder and execute the following command in console to start the application locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### :beer: Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

### Additional Resources

For additional resources on working with Clerk, MongoDB and Shadcn, refer to the official documentation.

- [Clerk](https://docs.clerk.dev/)
